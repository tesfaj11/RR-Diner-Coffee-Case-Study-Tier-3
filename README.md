# RR-Diner-Coffee-Case-Study-Tier-3
Overview
This project was completed as part of the Springboard Data Science curriculum. In this case study, I worked as the lead data scientist for RR Diner Coffee, a specialty coffee company exploring a high-impact deal with a new supplier in China.

The goal was to use customer data to inform a critical business decision by building several classification models using decision trees and random forests. The analysis followed a full data science workflowâ€”from data cleaning and feature encoding to model evaluation.

Objective
The business needed to determine whether purchasing coffee from the new supplier would lead to better customer satisfaction. I implemented and evaluated multiple decision tree models to make this prediction.

Models Used
Decision Tree using Gini Index (full depth)

Decision Tree using Gini Index (max depth = 4)

Decision Tree using Entropy (full depth)

Decision Tree using Entropy (max depth = 4)

Random Forest Classifier

Key Steps
Imported and cleaned the dataset (RRDinerCoffeeData.csv)

One-hot encoded categorical variables

Split the dataset into training and test sets

Trained and evaluated five classification models

Compared performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports

Results
The best-performing model was the full-depth Decision Tree using Gini index, which achieved the highest accuracy on the test data. The Random Forest model also performed well and offers a more robust approach to avoiding overfitting.
